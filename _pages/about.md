<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received the B.Sc. degree in electronic science and technology from Shanghai University of Electric Power in 2017 and the M.E. degree in integrated circuit engineering from Shanghai Jiao
Tong University in 2021. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology with Tsinghua University. My research interests include AI hardware security, side-channel attack, and machine learning security.

My research interest includes AI hardware accelerator and side-channel security. I have published some papers at the IEEE conferences and journals (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CryOyUsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
